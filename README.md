# Home Lab Projects

 I WAS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SERVER TECHNOLOGY ON MY HOME MACHINE CREATING AND MAINTAINING MY OWN ACTIVE DIRECTORY IMPLEMENTING BASIC SECURITY MEASURES AND I PLAN TO ADD A SIEM AND LEARN SECURITY OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND ADVANCE MY IT KNOWLEDGE

### HARDENING INCLUDES
1. **Strong Passwords**: Ensure all accounts use strong, complex passwords. This means a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
2. **Regular Updates**: I Keep my AD server on at all times and connected devices updated with the latest security patches and updates.
3. **Limiting Admin Access**: Only My Account has admin access with a Secure complex password.
4. **Enabling Firewall rules**: Made sure the firewall is enabled on my AD server to block unauthorized access.
5. **Backups Regularly**: Regularly back up your AD database and other critical data related to it. then I store the backups in a secure location.
6. **Disable Unnecessary Services**: Turning off any services or features that I do not need. reducing the potential attack surface.
7. **Monitoring Logs**: Regularly checking the event logs for any unusual activity, this can help you detect potential security issues early.
8. **Network Segmentation**: segmenting my network to isolate my AD server from other devices. This adds an extra layer of protection.
